Third party libraries:

These libraries will eventually be needed, to have full support. This is preliminary, and the libraries may be subject to change.

* boost
	Dependency of Assimp, also useful utilities.
	
* Assimp 3.0
	For loading models and textures, and managing the resource pipeline in a nice way.

* FreeType?
	For managing fonts and being able to render text
	
* Raknet
	For managing the network part. Is a good library, but will require indie registration (no catches from what I can see). Alternatives?

* FMOD
	For playing sounds and music
